How to initialize and connect a local repo to a remote:

git remote add origin remoteRepoURl
git push -u origin master

git status # Gives you the status of your files and tells us what version of the file we're working with

# adds <file> to staging area 
git add <file> 

# commits changes with comment 
git commit -m 'any comment' 

# combines add and commit in one line
git -a -m 'any comment' 

#Pushes local repo changes to remote repo
git push 

#Change to and create new branch
git checkout -b <branchName>

#Getting remote branches
git fetch

#Merge current branch with specified branch
git merge <branchYouWantToMerge>

#Delete Branch
git branch -d <branchToBeDeleted>
